You are not responsible for people's guidance O Prophet, it is Allah Who guides whoever He wills. Whatever you believers spend in charity, it is for your own good as long as you do so seeking the pleasure of Allah. Whatever you donate will be paid back to you in full, and you will not be wronged. Charity is for the needy who are too engaged in the cause of Allah to move about in the land for work. Those unfamiliar with their situation will think they are not in need of charity because they do not beg. You can recognize them by their appearance. They do not beg people persistently. Whatever you give in charity is certainly well known to Allah. Those who spend their wealth in charity day and night, secretly and openly, their reward is with their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve."

The scribe should not refuse to write as Allah has taught them to write. They will write what the debtor dictates, bearing Allah in mind and not defrauding the debt. If the debtor is incompetent, weak, or unable to dictate, let their guardian dictate for them with justice. Call upon two of your men to witness. If two men cannot be found, then one man and two women of your choice will witness so if one of the women forgets the other may remind her. The witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. You must not be against writing contracts for a fixed period, whether the sum is small or great. This is more just for you in the sight of Allah, and more convenient to establish evidence and remove doubts. However, if you conduct an immediate transaction among yourselves, then there is no need for you to record it, but call upon witnesses when a deal is finalized. Let no harm come to the scribe or witnesses. If you do, then you have gravely exceeded your limits. Be mindful of Allah, for Allah is the One Who teaches you.

It is truly a shameful deed and an evil way. Do not take a human life, made sacred by Allah, except with legal right. If anyone is killed unjustly, We have given their heirs the authority, but do not let them exceed limits in retaliation, for they are already supported by law. Do not come near the wealth of the orphan, unless intending to enhance it, until they attain maturity. Honour your pledges, for you will surely be accountable for them. Give in full when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is fairest and best in the end. Do not follow what you have no sure knowledge of. Indeed, all will be called to account for their hearing, sight, and intellect. And do not walk on the earth arrogantly. Surely you can neither crack the earth nor stretch to the height of the mountains. The violation of any of these commandments is detestable to your Lord."

Keep the punishment of Hell away from us, for its punishment is indeed unrelenting. It is certainly an evil place to settle and reside.' They are those who spend neither wastefully nor stingily, but moderately in between. They are those who do not invoke any other god besides Allah, nor take a human life, made sacred by Allah, except with legal right, nor commit fornication. And whoever does any of this will face the penalty. Their punishment will be multiplied on the Day of Judgment, and they will remain in it forever, in disgrace.

But it is We Who have sent this revelation to you. And you were not at the side of Mount Tur when We called out to Moses.

And the people of Aad and Thamud met a similar fate, which must be clear to you Meccans from their ruins. Satan made their evil deeds appealing to them, hindering them from the Right Way, although they were capable of reasoning. We also destroyed Korah, Pharaoh, and Hamaan. Indeed, Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they behaved arrogantly in the land. Yet they could not escape Us. So We seized each people for their sin: against some of them We sent a storm of stones, some were overtaken by a mighty blast, some We caused the earth to swallow, and some We drowned. Allah would not have wronged them, but it was they who wronged themselves."
